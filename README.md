# Hello Welcome to our project.


# We have done 10 tests. And we have done it in 3 testfiles one file for each person. 

# We have all a test setup and testsuite in our testfiles. 

# We have done diffrent tests and done one testmapp for each person. Each map contains our individual tests and pages.

#But we have all worked togheter with this test as a group. All in the group have also a loginpage and dashboardpage in ther testmap. 

# We have choosen to have diffrent ignore file in our testmaps beacue we have diffrent compute hardware and 

#then it differs what our computer want to remote to github from our local machines. 

# We choose to do a template env file with empty information about password and url to the hotell webiste and push it upp in a safe way to the main bransch.

#We want to show that we have created those variable.
